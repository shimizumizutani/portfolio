`Python` `TensorFlow` `PyTorch` `Pandas` `NumPy` `Scikit-learn` `Jupyter`

### Beyond Code
When I'm not training models, I'm reading, writing, and exploring art & design. I believe the best AI solutions come from understanding both data and human experience.

### Currently
- Building foundational knowledge in ML algorithms
- Working on personal projects to apply what I learn
- Documenting my journey through code
